autoreporter is a command line utility to repeatedly call some programs and display reports.

autoreporter's goal is to deal with management like buffering reports, dealing with errors, autorefreshing by clock, manually, or by file change.

[very little of that is actually implemented]

It's all very loosely inspired by rerun gem. [ https://github.com/rerun/rerun ]
